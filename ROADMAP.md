# Roadmap for Support

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still under active development and is not yet stable for
> production use.

Our goal here is to document the prioritized roadmap of target architectures we plan to test and eventually support as part of TheRock.

## Prioritized target architectures

The following is a list of prioritized roadmaps divided by OS (Linux/Windows) and architecture. Each individual section is its own roadmap and we will be in parallel trying to support at least one *new* architecture per section in parallel working top-to-bottom. Current focus areas are in __bold__. There will be exceptions from the "top-to-bottom" ordering occasionally based on test device availability.

> [!NOTE]
> For the purposes of the table below:
>
> - *Sanity-Tested* means "either in CI or some light form of manual QA has been performed".
> - *Release-Ready* means "it is supported and tested as part of our overall release process".
